## Center for Disease Neurogenomics
The [Center for Disease Neurogenomics (CDN)](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/neurogenomics) is expanding our knowledge of the genetic, cellular, and molecular processes that contribute to neuropsychiatric diseases. The overarching goal of the Center is to promote precision psychiatry by identifying the genetic variants and underlying mechanisms that cause disease and, ultimately, enabling personalized therapy. We are pioneering new techniques, systems, and processes to advance our goals. The Center studies Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, bipolar disorder, and other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. These diseases exact an enormous toll—both in terms of quality of life and health care costs—on a broad spectrum of the population.

## Single Cell Neurogenomics Group
While Neurogenomics studies have largely depended on bulk sequencing data for the past 10 to 15 years, advancements in computational power and tools are now enabling researchers to study genomics from the perspective of single cells. The [Single Cell Neurogenomics Group](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/neurogenomics/single-cell-neurogenomics), under the direction of [Donghoon Lee, PhD](https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/donghoon-lee), develops sophisticated computational and machine learning approaches to capture the underlying biological and pathological processes of neuropsychiatric diseases at the cellular level.

## Location
We are located at the Hess Center for Science and Medicine 8th floor (1470 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10029).

## Join Us
We are actively looking for a passionate computational biologist to join our adventure. To be considered, please submit a cover letter and CV to admin (at) leelaboratory (dot) org.
