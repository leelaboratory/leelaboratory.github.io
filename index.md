## Research 

In collaboration with the [Roussos Lab](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/roussos-lab/), we are primarily focused on developing methodologies for understanding the genetic basis of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

<br>

### Machine Learning

We frame biological problems using mathematical and statistical tools. Leveraging the wealth of single-nucleus and functional genomic data, we apply interdisciplinary approaches like statistical modeling and machine learning to interpret disease genomes.

### Regulatory Networks and Dynamics

Integrative approaches can uncover meaningful patterns and rules from large data. We identify cis-regulatory elements, build gene regulatory networks, and discover regulatory dynamics during transcription.
