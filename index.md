## Single Cell Neurogenomics Group at the Center for Disease Neurogenomics
While Neurogenomics studies have largely depended on bulk sequencing data for the past 10 to 15 years, advancements in computational power and tools are now enabling researchers to study genomics from the perspective of single cells. The Single Cell Neurogenomics Group, under the direction of [Donghoon Lee, PhD](https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/donghoon-lee), develops sophisticated computational and machine learning approaches to capture the underlying biological and pathological processes of neuropsychiatric diseases at the cellular level.
